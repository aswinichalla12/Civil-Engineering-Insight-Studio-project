🏗️ Civil Engineering Insight Studio
📌 Project Overview

Civil Engineering Insight Studio is a data-driven analytical platform designed to assist civil engineers, planners, and students in making informed decisions during infrastructure planning and design. The system analyzes project-related data such as structural parameters, materials, and costs to generate meaningful insights related to safety, efficiency, and sustainability.

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional civil engineering practices rely heavily on manual calculations and isolated tools, which can lead to design inefficiencies, safety risks, and cost overruns. There is a need for an integrated platform that provides accurate engineering insights to support better decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.
